# SSE4-CRC32

Nehalam-based Intel processors feature the Streaming SIMD Extensions instruction set which provide a
hardware-accelerated version of the CRC32 algorithm (Castagnoli variant). This library uses the Intel SSE 4.2
instruction set to provide a fast CRC-32 algorithm.


## Features

- Intel Streaming SIMD Extensions 4.2 based hardware accelerated CRC 32 calculation
- Progressive CRC32 calculation
- Supports Node.js buffers


## Usage

Using the library is quite simple. Start out by including the library in your code:

	var SSE4CRC32 = require("sse4_crc32");

To calculate the 32-bit CRC for any string, simply use the following code:

	var my_crc = SSE4CRC32.calculate("my string");

Instead of passing in a string, a buffer can be passed to the `calculate()` function.

To calculate CRC in a progressive manner, use the code snippet:

	var crc = new SSE4CRC32.CRC32(),
		my_inputs = [ "some string", new Buffer("a buffer"), "yet another string", new Buffer("yet another buffer") ],
		my_crc;

	my_inputs.forEach(function (string) {
		my_crc = crc.update(string);
	});

Also see the example code in the [examples](https://github.com/anandsuresh/sse4_crc32/tree/master/examples)
 directory.

## How to compile

Once the repository has been cloned, use one of the following commands to build the library:

	make all			// Builds the release version of the library and runs all tests
	make debug			// Builds the debug version of the library
	make clean			// Removes all files generated by builds
